ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE:
This software was collaboratively developed by NASA, Planetary Resources Inc., Harvard 
Business School and members of the Topcoder community.

As part of the NASA Asteroid Data Hunter project, the Topcoder community (topcoder.com)
worked with built an algorithm & software that is capable of identifying asteroids in 
images from ground-based telescopes. We were able to increase the detection sensitivity,
minimize the number of false positives & ignore imperfections in the data.

This software is open source - to find out more, please visit topcoder.com/asteroids.
