Asteroid-Data-Hunter
====================

NASA's Asteroid Data Hunter challenge tasked competitors to develop significantly improved algorithms to identify asteroids in images from ground-based telescopes. This winning solution increased the detection sensitivity, minimize the number of false positives, ignore imperfections in the data, and run effectively on all computers.
