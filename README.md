NASA's Asteroid Data Hunter



As part of this project, we built an algorithm that is capable of identifying asteroids in images from ground-based telescopes. We were able to increase the detection sensitivity, minimize the number of false positives, ignore imperfections in the data, and make it run effectively on all computers.

We're currently working on phase 2 - where we're building an application that will be so easy to use, that citizen scientists, hobbyist astronomers and even professional organizations/institutions will want to download the software.

The upcoming software will be open source and able to run effectively and within a reasonable amount of time on a common everyday laptop and it will contain a dead-simple user interface that anyone can use. 

Thanks!
